**Project Title:** AI Conversation Monitoring & Interaction Hub

**Project Overview:**

This project delivers a sophisticated, web-based dashboard application built using the **Next.js** framework. Its primary purpose is to provide a centralized command center for monitoring, analyzing, and interacting with AI-powered conversations orchestrated by **Genkit**. Leveraging **Firebase** for robust backend services (including data persistence, authentication, and potentially real-time updates), the dashboard offers comprehensive insights and control over the AI's performance and interactions, with specific integrations for **Evolution API** and **N8N**.

**Core Functionality & Detailed Feature Breakdown:**

1.  **Dashboard Overview & Key Metrics:**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides an immediate, high-level snapshot of the system's health and activity.
    *   **Features:** Displays critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) prominently, likely using visually engaging cards or gauges. This includes:
        *   **Total Conversation Count:** Tracks the overall number of conversations handled by the system.
        *   **Active/Ongoing Conversations:** Shows how many interactions are currently in progress.
        *   **Token Usage:** Monitors the consumption of tokens by the underlying LLMs (managed via Genkit), crucial for cost management and performance analysis. This might be broken down by time period (e.g., daily, monthly) or even by specific AI models/flows if applicable.
        *   **Average Conversation Length/Duration:** Potential metric for understanding user engagement.

2.  **External Service Integration Status:**
    *   **Purpose:** Ensures transparency regarding the operational status of critical external dependencies required for end-to-end functionality.
    *   **Features:** Dedicated status indicators (e.g., green/yellow/red icons or badges) clearly show the connectivity and health of:
        *   **Evolution API:** Vital for platforms relying on it (often WhatsApp Business API interaction), indicating if messaging ingress/egress is functional.
        *   **N8N:** Monitors the connection to the N8N instance, ensuring automated workflows triggered by or interacting with the conversations are operational. This visibility helps quickly diagnose issues related to external systems.

3.  **Conversation History & Analysis:**
    *   **Purpose:** Allows users to review past interactions, identify trends, and troubleshoot specific cases.
    *   **Features:**
        *   **Conversations Over Time Chart:** A graphical representation (e.g., line or bar chart) visualizing the volume of conversations processed over selected time periods (daily, weekly, monthly). This helps identify peak times, growth trends, or potential dips in activity.
        *   **Recent Conversations Table:** A detailed, sortable, and potentially searchable/filterable table listing individual conversations. Columns would likely include:
            *   Conversation ID
            *   Start/End Timestamp
            *   Status (Active, Paused, Completed, Failed)
            *   User/Contact Identifier
            *   Token Count (for that specific conversation)
            *   Last Message Snippet or Summary
            *   Link to view the full conversation detail.

4.  **Interactive Chat Panel & Conversation Management:**
    *   **Purpose:** Enables direct inspection and intervention within specific conversations.
    *   **Features:** Upon selecting a conversation (e.g., from the history table), this panel displays:
        *   **Full Transcript View:** Shows the complete exchange between the user and the AI, clearly distinguishing between participants.
        *   **Contextual Information:** May display relevant metadata associated with the conversation (e.g., user profile data, conversation tags, current Genkit flow step).
        *   **Message Input:** Allows authorized human operators to **join the conversation** and send messages directly to the end-user, overriding or supplementing the AI.
        *   **Action Buttons:** Provides controls to **manage** the conversation state (e.g., mark as resolved, escalate, assign to another agent/team if applicable).

5.  **Human Assistance Toggle & Pause Control:**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides a crucial mechanism for human agents to step in when AI reaches its limits or when manual intervention is required.
    *   **Features:**
        *   **Pause Functionality:** Allows operators to temporarily halt the AI's processing for a specific conversation or potentially globally (depending on implementation). This prevents the AI from responding while a human reviews or takes over.
        *   **Customizable Pause Durations:** Offers flexibility by allowing operators to set predefined pause times (e.g., 5 minutes, 1 hour) or require manual reactivation, preventing conversations from being indefinitely stuck in a paused state.
        *   **Clear Status Indication:** Visually indicates when a conversation is paused and awaiting human input.

6.  **User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX):**
    *   **Dark Mode:** Implements a visually comfortable and aesthetically pleasing dark theme, reducing eye strain during prolonged use, especially in low-light environments.
    *   **Responsive Design:** Built with Next.js, the interface should be responsive and adapt cleanly to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet).
    *   **Intuitive Navigation:** Clear layout and navigation patterns make it easy for users to find the information and tools they need.

**Technology Stack Summary:**

*   **Frontend Framework:** Next.js (React)
*   **AI/LLM Framework:** Genkit
*   **Backend Services:** Firebase (Firestore, Authentication, Functions, etc.)
*   **Key Monitored Integrations:** Evolution API, N8N

**Overall Goal:**

This dashboard aims to be the central nervous system for managing AI conversations powered by Genkit. It empowers administrators and support teams by providing real-time visibility into system performance, token consumption, and integration health, while offering robust tools for analyzing conversation history and enabling seamless human intervention when necessary, all within a user-friendly and modern interface.
